# akka-stream-random-examples

While preparing our slides for Scala Italy 2016, [me](https://github.com/mone/) and [gioiab](https://github.com/gioiab/) wrote a few akka stream examples.
In the end we discarded the examples and did something else, but this repo remains.

[Slides for the mentioned talk are here anyway](http://www.slideshare.net/joy87/a-dive-into-akka-streams-from-the-basics-to-a-realworld-scenario)
